                <h2>Side Projects - steps toward becoming proficient with React</h2>
                <h3>Building Resume with HTML + CSS</h3>
                <p>
                    Taking a beginners course on HTML and CSS because as a fullstack developer I found that it's possible
                    to get by with minimal knowledge when the codebase has good examples. However I would like
                    to be proficient on the FE side without copy & pasting every time I need to build
                    UI. 
                    To cement knowledge on the topic, I'm using what I learned to create my resume using HTML + CSS. Not
                    meant to be the prettiest resume, as using an online resume editor would be easier.
                </p>
                <h3>Wreck it Raplh site</h3>
                <p>
                    Another skillshare course to learn the very basics of HTML + CSS. Positioning,
                    display, box style layouts. On HTML side learning how to define structure of website.
                    Development process from creating Wireframe, to writing rough HTML, filling in CSS,
                    taking existing style sets and applying them.

                <p>
                    Super passionate about learning, but appreciate a worklife balance! Professionally
                    I like to participate in high-level design discussions, but then be left to implement it
                    the best way I discover. I do not need to be hand held or micro managed. I enjoy a mixture 
                    working in approachable areas at an office, so that anyone can find me for help or just 
                    casual conversation, and isolated focus time where I get the best work done, so I 
                    do not want to be disturbed unless its an emergency.
