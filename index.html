            <h2>Side Projects - steps toward becoming proficient with React</h2>
            <h3>Building Resume with HTML + CSS</h3>
            <p>
                Taking a beginners course on HTML and CSS because as a fullstack
                developer I found that it's possible
                to get by with minimal knowledge when the codebase has good
                examples. However I would like
                to be proficient on the FE side without copy & pasting every
                time I need to build
                UI.
                To cement knowledge on the topic, I'm using what I learned to
                create my resume using HTML + CSS. Not
                meant to be the prettiest resume, as using an online resume
                editor would be easier.
            </p>
            <h3>Wreck it Raplh site</h3>
            <p>
                Another skillshare course to learn the very basics of HTML +
                CSS. Positioning,
                display, box style layouts. On HTML side learning how to define
                structure of website.
                Development process from creating Wireframe, to writing rough
                HTML, filling in CSS,
                taking existing style sets and applying them.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="aboutMe">
            <p>
                Super passionate about learning, but appreciate a worklife
                balance! Professionally
                I like to participate in high-level design discussions, but then
                be left to implement it
                the best way I discover. I do not need to be hand held or micro
                managed. I enjoy a mixture
                working in approachable areas at an office, so that anyone can
                find me for help or just
                casual conversation, and isolated focus time where I get the
                best work done, so I
                do not want to be disturbed unless its an emergency.
